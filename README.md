## Scenario

### User Story

### Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a functional Express.js API 
- [x] When I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file, then I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize. 
- [x] When I enter schema and seed commands, then a development database is created and is seeded with test data.
- [x] When I enter the command to invoke the application, then my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.
- [x] When I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags, then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.
